<p>The Temple of Three Winds is a dungeon in Rubi-Ka located just North of Tir. Clanners and Omni-Tek get to this location in two very different ways:</p>

<p><b>Clan:</b> The Temple of Three Winds is not far from the city of Tir. The best place to start off from is the Tir West Gate. From here, travel straight North and very very slightly to the West. You will reach a zone. After zoning, you will see a large mountainous region. You will want to go <i>just</i> to the right of this area, but not too close as there are some level 30-40 level mobs located there. After traveling North for about thirty seconds, you should see a Clan outpost. You will definently want to stop here as it has the Insurance Terminal that will bring you nearest to the Temple of Three Winds if you, er, when you die. There is also a Basic Shop here and two Bank Terminals! One located ouside and one located in the shop, of course. When you are finished here, simply travel North a short distance and you will see three spires. That is the Temple of Three Winds. Just aim for the center spire and you'll be there in no time!</p>

<p><b>Omni:</b> There is a Windcaller by the name of Cerrak near the South entrance of Rome Green, leading from Rome Red District. Just take the first two rights and look for a stack of large crates. <a href="http://ao.cylence.org/temple/media/cerrak.txt">Talk to him</a>, give him 1,000 credits and he will give you the <a href="http://aodb.info/showitem.asp?AOID=207023" target="_blank">Temple of Three Winds Key</a>.</p>

<p>This key allows you to go through the portal that is near him (left click on the Sealed Inner Sanctum Pass then right-click on the portal). This, of course, makes your trip to the Temple of Three Winds much faster than that of a Clanner, but the disadvantage is that you have no available Insurance Terminals near the Temple of Three Winds at which you can save. The question of how you get back home can be answered by most any of the higher level mobs. Feel free to ask one of them at any time! I'm sure they'd be glad to show you.</p>

<p>Almost all items found in The Temple of Three Winds are NODROP. This means that they cannot be given  or sold to anyone else. Because of this, you must get these items for yourself. However, if you are at a lower level (10-30) you can hire others to guide you through the Temple and protect you so that you might pick up items normally reserved for higher level players (50-60). For example, the level restriction for an Exarch Robe is only 20, though a level 21 usually is not strong enough to get to where the Exarch Robes are found. If a level 20 character found an escourt to this area and got an Exarch Robe, he would be a <i>very</i> well armored level 21 character!</p>

<p>There are some very powerful bosses in this dungeon, so teams are quite essential for getting very far. When you get around level 40 to 50, teams do play a slightly smaller roll, though they are still essential for defeating most of the bosses.</p>

<p>A new feature of the Temple of Three Winds, released in the 14.9 patch, is the need for an <a href="http://ao.cylence.org/temple/guides/item_is.php">Inner Sanctum Knowledge</a> in order to get into the Inner Sanctum dungeon. This is a level 125 and higher only dungeon, so the people who need the passes are most commonly much too high to get into the Temple of Three Winds. An <a href="http://ao.cylence.org/temple/guides/item_robes.php">Exarch Robe</a> can be given to any Blind Cultist in exchange for an <a href="http://ao.cylence.org/temple/guides/item_is.php">Inner Sanctum Knowledge</a>. The <a href="http://ao.cylence.org/temple/guides/item_robes.php">Exarch Robe</a> is NODROP but the Inner Sanctum Knowledge is not, thus the Inner Sanctum Knowledge can be sold to higher level players for a decent amount of credits. The <a href="http://ao.cylence.org/temple/guides/item_is.php">Inner Sanctum Knowledge</a> is usually sold for any amount from 250,000 credits to 500,000 credits on average. There are many pushing to lower the average cost of this pass, but for a low level character (even up to level 60), even 200,000 credits can be a fortune!</p>
